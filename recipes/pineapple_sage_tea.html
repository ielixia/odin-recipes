    <h1>Pineapple Sage Tea</h1>
    <img src="pineapplesagetea.JPG" width="300" height="400" alt="my pineapple sage bush during summer">
    <h3>Pineapple sage is from the sage family, and smells like pineapple.
    <br>It is a popular addition to cocktails to enhance its flavour, with plentiful of benifical properties.</h3>
        During summer months, it will grow abundantly and thus I have made it into tea.
        There are many benefits of pineapple sage tea such as:
        <ul>
            <li>anti-depressant properties</li>
            <li>anti-anxiety properties</li>
            <li>balances the nervous system</li>
            <li>assists with digestion issues such as heartburn</li>
        </ul>
        It can be infused freshly picked, or dehydrated for storage. Due to the abundance
        of my pineapple sage harvest, I will be going through how I store them away.
    <h2>Steps to dehydrate pineapple sage</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Collect clean, fresh leaves that are free of damage from your plant.</li>
            <li>Cleanse the leaves in a clean water basin or bucket by adding some salt and leave
                for 20 minutes. <em>I add roughly 10g of salt per 100ml of water used. </em></li>
            <li>Shake off excess water by placing leaves in a salad spinner. <sup>[1]</sup></li>
            <li>Lay out leaves nicely inside a dehydrator.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
            <li>Set dehydrator setting to 55 degrees Celsius at 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Collect the dehydrated leaves and store it in an airtight, clean container.</li>
        </ol>
        <sup>[1]</sup>You can omit this step if you do not have a salad spinner.
        <br><sup>[2]</sup>If you do not have a dehydrator, then place leaves on a clean surface and place in a spot where the sun can airdry the leaves.
